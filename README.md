# About Java Programming
--> Java is a widely-used, high-level, object-oriented programming language.<br><br>
--> Known for its platform independence, which allows programs to run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).<br><br>
--> Originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation).<br><br>
--> Java code is typically written in text files with a .java extension.

# Mode of Execution Used:  <img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/images/code-stable.png" title="Visual Studio Code" alt="Visual Studio Code" width="40" height="40"> &nbsp; <img src="https://github.com/madhurimarawat/Java-Programming/assets/105432776/21fbc4f4-3bb0-4ea9-95b7-e5a7e52d6f93" title="JDK" alt="JDK" width="50" height="40">

<h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>
--> Visit the official website:&nbsp; <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download"><img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/images/code-stable.png" title="Visual Studio Code" alt="Visual Studio Code" width="30" height="30"></a><br><br>
--> Download according to the platform that will be used like Linux, Macos or Windows.<br><br>
--> Follow the setup wizard.<br><br>
--> Create a new file with the extention of .java and then this file can be executed using java.<br>
<h2>Java</h2>
--> Visit the official website of Java: https://www.java.com/en/ <br><br>
--> Download according to the platform that is going to be used.<br><br>
--> After downloading, load the executble file and follow along the process.<br>
<h2>Java Developement Kit</h2>
--> Visit the official website of Oracle: https://www.java.com/en/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/ <br><br>
--> Download according to the platform that is going to be used.<br><br>
--> After downloading, load the executable file and follow along the process.

# Executing Java Code
--> Open the command prompt in the working directory of java code file.<br><br>
--> First the java code file is executed using java compiler with the following command:-

```
javac java-codefile.java
```
where java-codefile.java is the name of java code file. Make sure the name of class and code file is same else it gives error.<br><br>
--> Now if this will run successfully a class file with the same name as code file will be saved in the directory.<br><br>
--> Now run the following command to get output :-
```
java java-codefile
```
where java-codefile.java is the name of java code file. Also we do not need to mention extention here.

# Java Programming Features

  - Strongly typed and statically compiled language.
  - Automatic memory management via garbage collection.
  - Rich standard library and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
  - Multi-threading support for concurrent programming.
  - Exception handling for robust error management.
  - Object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism.<br><br>
  
--> **Syntax and Structure**
  - Java programs consist of classes.
  - A class defines data (fields/variables) and methods (functions).
  - The `public static void main(String[] args)` method is the entry point for execution.
  - Statements end with a semicolon (`;`).<br><br>

--> **Data Types**
  - Primitive data types: `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.
  - Reference data types: `String`, arrays, user-defined classes.<br><br>

--> **Control Structures**
  - `if`, `else if`, and `else` for conditional branching.
  - `for`, `while`, and `do-while` for loops.
  - `switch` for multi-branch decision-making.<br><br>

--> **Object-Oriented Programming**
  - Classes and objects for code organization.
  - Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism principles.
  - Constructors and destructors.<br><br>

--> **Exception Handling**
  - `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks for error handling.
  - Throwing and catching exceptions.<br><br>

--> **Garbage Collection**
  - Automatic memory management for freeing unused objects.
  - Helps prevent memory leaks leading to better memory management.<br><br>
  
--> **Platform Independence**
  - Compiled Java bytecode runs on any platform with a compatible JVM(Java Virtual Machine).
  - This makes java a platform independent programming language.
